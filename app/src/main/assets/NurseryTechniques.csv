0,Nursery Management Tips ,General,"1. Potting Mixture ( Nursery-Soil)
There is a tendency to collect the topsoil from forest area to fill the
polythene bags. This practice is not good as it contributes to soil erosion.
The whole success of nursery depends on good soil mixture. It should be
light in weight, well decomposed and well drained and free from insects as
well as weed seeds.
Always use compost in the nursery. It can easily be prepared by
decomposing organic materials (green leaves). It increases the nutrient
contents of the potting mixture and enhances the air spaces and water
holding capacity of the mixture.
2. Seed Collection and Sowing
Always collect seeds from plus trees or phcnotypically superior trees.
A chart should be prepared in each nursery indicating the seed collection
period of local tree species along with the location of plus trees.
Seedlings developed from poor or abnormal trees will never produce good
trees.
After collection seeds should be processed carefully otherwise they may get
damaged and loose viability.
Each species requires different processing after seed collection i.e. seeds
with pulp (kadam) are to be processed in a different way than the pods
(mandhani), drupes (bonsum and dhuna) and capsules (bogipoma and
khokan).
In tropical area most of the seeds have short viability, therefore, sowing is
to be done immediately after collection and processing the seeds.
Sow large seeds 2cm  to 3cm deep in the soil.
Sow small seeds (Kadam, Khokan) about 0.5 to 1cm deep or broadcast and
cover them with a small amount of fine soil. The beds can also be covered
with thatch or plastic sheet till the germination of seeds.
3. Watering
Keep seedbeds moist not wet.
Do not water at a fixed time each day. Water when the plants need it.
Small seedlings require less amount of water.
19
Large seedlings require more water more often.
Seedlings require more water more often on windy days and sunny days.
Water less often when seedlings are kept in shade.
The moss and algae growth is an indication of excess watering.
Always use clean water; dirty water may cause disease problem.
Over-watering results into weak plants and causes diseases such as root-rot
and damping-off of seedlings.
4. Transplanting
Water  mother beds thoroughly before transplanting the seedlings.
Always use some tools (bamboo-sticks, etc.) to loosen the soil before
pulling out seedling from the beds.
Make a deep and wide hole in the polythene bag or container for
transplanting the seedling.
Hold seedlings at the base of the stem and pull it out gently from the
mother beds.
Never bend the roots and do not force the seedlings to fit into the hole.
Keep transplanted seedlings under proper shade until they have recovered.
5. Hardening of Seedlings
In a nursery seedlings are kept under ideal condition, therefore,
hardening is essential to make them strong enougli to tolerate the harsh
conditions of field/
 planting site. It is generally done by reducing the
amount of watering about one month before the date of planting.
6. Nursery Hygiene an d Disease Control
Most of the micro-organisms, insects and pests that cause diseases in
the nursery live in weeds, trash and puddles. Therefore, keeping nursery
in neat and clean condition to reduces the chances of attack of common
diseases. All trash, waste, polythene bags and diseased plants should
immediately be removed and burnt at a place far from the nursery.
Pesticides Recommended : Diazinon. Melathion, Sevin
Fungicides Recommended : Bavisteen. Benlate, Captan. Dithane M-45
Dangerous Pesticides : Aldicarb. Aldrin, DDT, Lindane, Nuvacron,
Heptachlor, etc. These are very dangerous.
Never use them.
Natural insecticides : Neem Seeds: Make powder of 500g dried
neem seeds and soak overnight in 15 litres
tap water. Sieve it twice and spray. Besides
this, chilli powder and tobacco leaves powder
can also be used. They generally take little
longer to repel or kill the insects, therefore,
apply them immediately as soon as insect
problem is noticed. The main advantage is
that they are natural, hence safe and
biodegradable. Remember the following
things while using them:
Proper doses should be prepared by carefully reading the label or guidelines.
Always provide protective clothing, mask, gloves and goggle to the person
spraying the pesticide.
Never mix insecticides and fungicides together in the same sprayer.
Never eat, drink or smoke while spraying.
Never use pesticides containers to store other things.
Extra pesticides should be disposed by digging a hole away from rivers and
wells."
1,Lagerstroemia speciosa,"Ajhow, Jarul, Sida, Pride Of India","Seed - germinates readily. Seeds should be sown in the shade, germination takes 15 - 56 days. After germination the small seedlings can be pricked out and transferred to containers. Seedlings grow slowly, often being no more than 5 - 30cm tall at the end of their first year - they usually speed up somewhat after this. Stumps with a shoot length of 5-10 cm, a root length of 10-20 cm and a diameter of 5-25 mm have shown 90-100 % survival. Seeds can store for at least 2 years in airtight containers at room temperature. Cuttings. Division of root suckers."
2,Amoora wallichii,Amari,"A tall evergreen species, which is a pronounced shade bearer, frost
tender and sensitive to fire. It prefers moist areas where water does not stagnate.
Fruits yellowish brown, quite large in size, 3 to 4-celled capsules with milky juice
when unripe. Fruits can be collected from June to July. It is better to collect fruits
from standing trees rather than collecting them from the ground. After collection
fruits are spread under proper sunlight for two to three days to open out and seeds
are extracted, washed and dried.. Seeds have scarlet aril and chestnut brown testa.

Nursery management Sowing must be done in
Shaded beds to obtain good
germination.
Sowing is done immediately after collection and processing the
seeds in shaded nursery beds, as viability is low. Seeds are sown in polythene bags
by keeping its long axis horizontal to the ground. Germination starts after 15 days
of sowing and few seeds may germinate even after 189 days (Krishnaswami,
1956). (Roychowdhry, 1960) reported 85% germination within 10-20 days in
shaded nursery beds while it was only 35% in un-shaded beds. Young seedlings
thrive better in shade and require regular weeding to protect them from weeds. In
Assam, seedlings are planted under the shade of Tephrosia Candida to protect it
from direct sunlight ( Joshi et. al. 1981). The species is suitable for wet areas and
requires proper weeding in initial stage."
3,Phoebe goalparensis,Bonsum,"It is a tall evergreen tree with a compact crown having a clean bole
of 14 to 17 m length. It flowers profusely during April to May. Fruits - drupe,
purple, 1.0 to 1.5 cm long, mesocarp thin, aromatic. The ripen fruits are just like
jamun fruits in appearance and are eaten by the birds and wild animals. They are
collected by lopping the branches and dried under shade till the thin mesocarp gets
dried. Care should be taken during the extraction of the seeds as over-drying may
result in the breaking of seed coat thereby damaging the seeds. Seeds are
recalcitrant, therefore, can not be stored for a long period.

Nursery management Removal of thin mesocarp is
essential before the sowing of
the seeds. Seeds are sown
immediafeiy after drying in
the month of November.
Sowing is done in the properly shaded mother beds at the depth of
1.5-2.0 cm in soil by keeping the pointed end of the seeds upward. Germination is
hypogeal. It starts after about 25 days of sowing and continues to about 90 days
possibly due to the prevailing cold weather during this part of the year. Seedlings
become ready for transplantation after about four months of sowing when they are
in three-leaf stage. Transplanting should be done under proper shade and once
established, seedlings can be kept in open beds. They become ready for plantation
after about six months of transplanting. Stump planting is also successful to some
extent under aided natural regeneration in this species."
4,Ailanthus grandis,Borpat,"It is a fast growing species, which occurs naturally up to 1200m in
tropical moist and deciduous forests. It is a lofty evergreen tree with a straight
cylindrical bole and a very small conical crown. It prefers a deep, moist welldrained
sandy loam soil. It is a light demander species which coppices fairly well
and also produces root suckers. Flowering occurs in September and fruits ripe from
February to March. Fruits-winged samara, seeds light brown in colour with a very
thin membranous testa and oily cotyledons. Fruits can be collected by lopping the
branches when they become light brown in colour. It can also be collected from the
ground but care should be taken to discard the insect-damaged seeds. It is erratic in
flowering and fruiting habit and fruiting output. No two consecutive seed years are
good and there is differential fruiting from tree to tree even within the same
plantation (Guhathakurta & Ghosh, 1972).

Sowing is done directly in the polythene bags. It is better to remove
the wings before sowing and seeds are sown flat/horizontal in the beds. It has a
long period of dormancy which breaks automatically with the onset of monsoon,
therefore, seeds sown in March take as long as 41 days to start the germination
(Guhathakurta & Ghosh, 1972). However, in an experiment conducted at SFRI
nursery the germination started after 23 days of sowing. Shade is necessary in the
initial stages of seedling development. Naked root transplanting has not given good
result and attempts to raise plantation by stump planting have failed so far
(Guhathakurta & Ghosh, 1972)."

6,Chukrasia velutina,Bogipoma,"It is a tall evergreen tree with spreading crown having a clean bole
of 15 to 17m lengths. Fruits - 3-valved septicidal capsules, 3.5 to 5.0 cm long.
Seeds 6 to 8 mm long, elliptic and flat with a dark brown wing (10 mm to 14 mm
long). Flowering occurs from April to May and fruits start ripening by the second
week of January and can be collected up to March. The experiment conducted at
SFRI on different stages of pod maturity and germination revealed that pods
collected at later stages of ripening gave better germination. It was observed that
during 1999 in most of the species, seeds matured about one month early than their
normal period of seeding possibly due to the continuous dry spell from December
to April. The ripened fruits/capsules are collected from the standing trees by
lopping the small branches and dried in shade for one week. Each fruit has 250 to
400 seeds. The capsules are opened with a gentle hammering or with a knife to
collect the winged seeds. Seeds are orthodox and can be stored for more than a
year under controlled condition (6 % moisture and 4 °C).

Sowing is done in properly shaded mother beds having a mixture of
sand, FYM and soil (1:1:1). Germination starts after one week of sowing and
seedlings are ready for transplantation into the polythene bags after about 30 to 45
days of sowing. They can be made available for planting by the first week of July
but it requires adequate planning for timely completion of all operations. Direct
sowing as well as stump planting is also successful provided the area is protected
from the mithun which causes damage to the seedlings as it gets a good passage to
move along the planting lines."
7,Dysoxylum binectariferum,Bandordima,Seed
8,Morus laevigata,Bola,"A valuable timber species, which occurs in tropical evergreen and
mixed deciduous forests in moist localities and thrives best on well-drained alluvial
soil. It is a light demander and fairly frost tender. Seeds are generally available
from April to first week of May. However, care should be taken to collect the seeds
from the trees which are known to be fertile as apparently all the trees are not
fertile. Fruits are collected by lopping of matured catkins bearing branches. After
collection they are soaked in water for 24 to 48 hours to allow the decomposition
of pulp. Seeds are separated by rubbing it over a wire-mesh, washed and dried
under shade.

Pre-sowing treatment Not required
Sowing method Mother beds
Germination period 10-45 days
Nursery management Care should be taken at the
time of sowing of seeds and
watering the beds as there are
chances of damage due to very
light weight of the seeds.
Seeds are sown at the depth of 0.5cm to 1.0 cm in mother beds or
trays. Watering is done carefully so that seeds are not washed away. The
germination starts after 10 to 15 days of sowing and continues up to about five
weeks. Seedlings are transplanted after about two months of sowing or at four
leaves stage when they become about four inches tall. Seedlings become ready for
plantation after about 4 to 6 months of transplanting. Stump planting is also quite
successful in this species. At an elevation of 5000 feet winter transplanting with
ball of earth is reported to have given 100 % success. It coppices and pollards well.
The growth is rapid in first few years but slows down gradually"
9,Terminalia bellirica,"Bahera, Bhomda","Seed - pre-soaking in cold water for 24 hours prior to sowing has been reported to improve germination rates. Buried seeds have a better chance of successful germination. The germination rate is quite high for fresh seeds, with reports of 85 - 100% germination, but it declines rapidly when seeds have been stored for some time. Germination needs much moisture, and usually takes 2 - 5 weeks. Usually sown in a nursery seedbed, the seed can also be sown directly in the field when conditions are favourable. When seedlings are raised in the nursery, transplanting to the field before the taproot has developed is strongly preferable, and mostly successful. Clipping the roots and shoots checks growth considerably, stumping is not advised."
10,Magnolia champaca,"Champaca, Sopa, Titasopa","It is a tall evergreen tree with a close, tapering crown - having clean long
cylindrical bole of 18-21 m suppressing all its associates. The mature trees have
branches at the top only as it cleans up lower branches (self-pruning) well even in
its early stages.. It does not stand waterlogging and prefers well-drained soil.
Flowering occurs in April or May and fruits can be collected from August to
September next year by plucking the fruits. Proper care should be taken while
collecting the seeds as fruit ripening takes more than one year, therefore, branches
bearing the mature fruits also bear the flowers of the current year. Fruits aggregate
of follicles, consists of long clusters of dark brown follicles on a thalius (7.5 to 15
cm long), opening at the back by two valves. Seeds brown, angular, covered with
a pink fleshy arillus. Seeds are oily and loose viability within few weeks. Seed year
records from West Bengal show that a good seeding may be expected almost evenyear
but in Assam, a good seed year is reported to occur once in three years

11,Canarium resiniferum,Dhuna,"A gigantic tree with a spherical crown having a clean gray bole of
30 to 35-m length. It occurs in the tropical moist evergreen and moist mixed
deciduous forests. Fruits - drupe, 2.5 to 5.0 cm long, pointed at both ends,
mesocarp fleshy, stone hard, aromatic, seeds trigonous, usually 3- celled with
three seeds. Flowering occurs from February to April and fruits start maturing from
November to January. The ripen furits/drupes are collected by lopping the small
branches, the fleshy mesocarp is removed with a sharp knife, and seeds are dried
under proper shade for about a week. Fruits are eaten by the wild animals and it
was noticed that local people make a machan over the tree to kill the animals (deer)

separated and transplanted into
the polythene bags.
Seeds are soaked in tap water for 24 hrs after that water is drained

vertically to keep micropyle upward. Germination is epigeal; it starts after about
three weeks of sowing and continues upto 120 days specially if sowing is done
during winter months. 95% germination was observed on sand substratum at Seed
Testing Laboratory, SFRI. Transplanting is done in the polythene bags when
seedlings attain 3-leaves stage. Initial growth of the seedlings is very fast and they
become ready for plantation after about two months of transplanting. It can be
successfully raised by direct sowing in fields at the onset of monsoon rains."
12,Gmelina arborea,Gamari,"Seed - pre-treatment is not necessary, though for quick germination, the seeds should be soaked for 48 hours in warm water. The seeds germinate within 20 - 50 days under ideal conditions; the average rate for a healthy seed lot is 60%. Trees can be raised easily by transplanting, which is carried out in the rainy season, or by direct sowing in lines; the latter has proved to be more successful in some instances. Viable seeds should be collected from standing trees of superior phenotype. Normally, seed is collected from the ground, depulped and the stones are dried. Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; viability can be maintained for several years in hermetic storage at 3Â°c with 7-10% mc. Large cuttings planted during the rainy season do well."
13,Cinnamomum tamala,Gonsordi,"Seed - the seed has a short viability and is best sown as soon as it is ripe. Remove the fruit pulp since this can inhibit germination. Germination can take 1 - 6 months at 20Â°c. Stored seed should be sown as soon as possible in containers. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out into their permanent positions when 10cm or more tall. Cuttings of semi-ripe side shoots, 7cm with a heel."
14,Terminalia myriocarpa,Hollock,"A large evergreen tree with a spreading crown and long pendulous
branchlets. The panicles of small, pink young fruits start appearing from October
to November and fruits ripen from end of December to January. Fruits drupe,
yellow, 3- cornered, and the lateral corners developing into short wings. The wings
are initially pink in color, become yellow later on and are a good indication about
the maturity of the seeds. The tree usually seeds welt but occasionally a poor seed
year may intervene. Seeds are very small, light in weight, and collected by lopping
the smaller branches. After plucking the seeds are dried under proper shade for two
to three days. Seeds are gently beaten in a bag and separated from wings by
winnowing. Sowing should be done immediately as seed loose viability within
three months of collection.

Sowing is done in mother beds in lines at 10 to 15 cm intervals after
that the beds are covered with straw/thatch and watering is done as and when
required. Germination is epigeous and starts after about 10 days of sowing.
Seedlings can be pricked out when they attain four-leaved stage. At initial stage
polythene bags with newly transplanted seedlings need to be kept under shade,
which can later be transferred to open beds. A heavy shade may result in etiolation
and development of poor seedlings. Previous experience shows that the direct
sowing in furrows made in the plantation areas after controlled burning gives good
result. "

The species is not particularly hard-seeded and requires only mild treatment (e.g. in water at 50 Â°c for 3 minutes) to germinate successfully. Be careful, though, since some seeds are quite thin-skinned and can be damaged if the water is too hot. A proportion of the seeds germinate immediately without any treatment. Plants can be direct-sown, container grown, or raised in a massed seed-bed and planted out as bare-rooted stems.

19,Lannea coromandelica,Jia,"The bark contains tannins. It is used for the impregnation of fishnets.  A soluble resin, called 'Jingan gum' is obtained from the stems. It is used for calico printing; as a size for paper; for mixing with lime when whitewashing; protecting nets etc. It is obtained by making shallow, short cuts all over the bark. Especially after injuries of the bark and trimmings, masses of glassy-white exudate of hardening gum appear - which may give leafless trees an eerie appearance. A good quality gum. The gum is of inferior quality.  The bark yields a coarse cordage fibre.  The heartwood is light red when freshly cut, turning reddish-brown on exposure. The wood is moderately hard, close-grained. It is used for spear shafts, scabbards, wheel-spokes, oil presses, grain pounders etc."
20,Syzigium jambosa,"Jam, Jamoon","Seed - the seeds have a very short viability and no dormancy; they usually germinate well within 10 - 120 days if sown fresh. Surface sow the seed in a shady position, firming it gently into the soil, and water well but be careful not to wash the seed away. A single seed often gives rise to 3 - 8 seedlings and most of them are true to type. Young plants transplant badly, so should be potted up into individual containers as soon as they are large enough to handle and before the roots have grown much. Young plants need some shade. Air layering."
21,Toona ciliata,"Jatipoma, Poma, Mountain Cedar",Seed - germinates quicker and better under shade. It should be broadcast thinly on raised and shaded nursery beds soon after collection. Germination takes 8 - 15 days and fresh seed has a germination rate of 50 - 80%. Natural regeneration is profuse even in areas outside its natural range. Good natural reproduction can be induced by clearing the ground in the vicinity of seed bearers. Orthodox seed storage behaviour; 90% germination after 12 monthsâ€™ storage in polythene bags at 5 - 8Â°c with 34-12.9% mc; complete loss of viability after 3 months at room temperature.

large flower at branch tips. Fruit-capsule. The tree generally produces good seed
crop every year and on an average a medium sized tree produces 40 to 50 kg. fresh
capsules. The capsules are green when young and become black at maturity. The
capsules can be collected by lopping the small branches, dried in sun for 2-3 days
and seeds are removed by gently thrashing the dried capsules. One-kilogram fresh
capsules give about 70-80 gms seeds. Seeds are very small and about 48% of them

10 - 40 days
Young seedlings are very minute,
therefore, requires proper care during
watering. Excessive watering is
harmful and may lead to damping-off
of seedling.
Raised mother beds having a mixture of sand and soil (1:1) should
be prepared with proper shade to protect the seedlings from rainfall. The beds
should be watered before sowing so that the seeds do not get washed away.
Broadcasting about 5 gm seeds in 1 m x 1 m bed and the beds are covered by
thatch or straw does sowing. Germination starts after 10-12 days and seedlings are
ready for transplantation in polythene bags after 50-60 days of sowing when they
attain two-leaves stage. Seed shows positive preference of light for germination
and gave fast and maximum germination of 80% in continuous light but failed to
germinate in dark (Shukla & Ramakrishnan, 1981). After transplanting the
seedlings, the polythene bags are kept in shade for about a month. The initial
growth of the seedlings is very slow but it picks up from September onwards and
seedlings become 60 cm to 70 cm high by the end of April and the roots start
penetrating the ground. The seedling height can be manipulated managed by
extending the date of sowing as per the requirement"
23,Neolamarckia cadamba,Kadam,"A tall deciduous tree of moist tropical regions. It exhibit self pruning and bears
branches at the top only. The flower buds grow at branch tips, the inflorescence appears
just like green balls. Fruit is a pseudocarp, a globose fleshy mass of closely packed
capsules, each containing a large number of minute seeds. The fruits ripe twice a year, first
in January to February and again from October to November. However, seeds collected
during winter gives better germination. Fruits are collected by lopping the branches when
the green colour of fruit changes to yellowish. Birds and rodents destroy a fair quantity of
seed. After collection, fruits are soaked in water for 3 to 4 days and then heaped under
shade for about a week until the pulp rots and becomes loose. Fruits are then rubbed to
form a. paste like slum' and sieved through a fine mesh. The seeds are very minute and
remain viable for about 12 months; however, by this time its germination capacity drops to
around 5%. Therefore, it is better to sow the seeds within 6 months of collection to get
better results. Each seed produces one to two seedlings.

Nursery Management Watering should be done carefully with a
fine sprayer in the initial stages, because
seeds are very minute and improper
watering may wash away seeds as well as
the seedlings. Seeds should be cleaned
properly as seeds with pulp give around
4.8% germination only (Beniwal &
Dhawan. 1991).
As the seeds are extremely light in weight it is better if sowing is done in
small trays or wooden boxes (45 an x 45 cm). A mixture of fine soil and sand in 1:1 ratio
is better. It is better to put a cover of grass till germination occurs. The beds should be
prepared in such a place so that proper sunlight is available throughout the day.
Germination is epigeous and starts after about a week of sowing and seedling are ready for
transplantation in 60 to 75 days. According to the field experiences providing of light
during night may hasten the germination. It should be done under shade and after 4 to 5

24-30 m and a girth of 3 m or more. It is found from Nepal, eastwards through Sikkim,
Bhutan, West Bengal to Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, and Manipur. It is also
found in Meghalaya and in dry deciduous forests of upper Assam. It is common in
foothills up to an elevation of 1500 m mixed with Shorea robusta and other miscellaneous
species. It has a great demand as a plywood timber. It is evergreen, though sometimes
shedding its leaves and becoming almost leafless by the end of March. It flowers
in April - May, (flower- similar to tea plant) and fruits in February-March. In Assam,
the flowering and fruiting takes place one or two month later. Fruits - capsule, five
celled, 1.3 to 1.8 cm in diameter, supported by the persistent calyx at maturity. Each
fruit has 2 to 6 seeds in each cell, flat, pale greyish - brown, surrounded by a papery
wing. Fruits are collected by lopping the branches before they open, dried in sunlight,
and seeds are released by gentle thrashing of dried fruits. Seeds are recalcitrant and can
be stored in airtight containers for 4 months. Good seed years appears to be common.

seeds are attacked and eaten by weevils, pigs, porcupines and other animals. Local people
also collect them for burning. The fruits are collected either from the ground or directly
from the trees itself. It should be collected when they are fully mature otherwise
germination percentage is less. After collection, fruits are spread out in the sun until they
dehisce and seeds are dried in shade. Seeds kept in open cracks and loose its viability
rapidly. Seeds being recalcitrant can not be dried to lower moisture content. According to
Bahuguha & Rawat (1989) 27 % viability can be obtained even after 4 months of storage
if seeds are kept at 5 °C in perforated polythene bags Sowing should be done
immediately otherwise its viability is lost. During storage seeds should be spread out

Sowing is generally done in polythene bags, however, it is better if seeds are
germinated in mother beds and the sprouted seeds are then transplanted to polythene bags.
Seeds are placed on their edges at a depth of 1-2 cm. Germination is hypogeous and starts
after 10-12 days of sowing. Soaking of seeds in cold water for 24 hours hasten the
germination. The seeds seem to be slightly dormant as they took around 15 days for
initiation of germination. It is probably due to the seed coat as the excised embryos exhibit
full potential of the germination ( Behuguna & Rawat, 1989). Seedlings are transplanted to
poly bags at four-leaved stage or after about one month of sowing. They become ready for
planting in the field by the next rainy season. It has also been observed that seedlings from
the open nurseries i.e. one not under natural shade survive better than the seedlings from
evergreen forest nurseries"

34,Pinus kesiya,Khashi Pine,"Seed - some highland provenances have a slight temperature dormancy, and it is recommended to cool down imbibed seed for 2 - 3 weeks in a refrigerator before sowing. Pre-soaking the seed in warm water at 40 - 50Â°c, then cooling it down for a night enhances germination. Sowing in sand in a seedbed and transplanting into polythene tubes is most common. Germination is quite fast for pre-treated seed - usually 5 - 20 days. Time in the nursery is 6 months to 1 year, planting out when the plants are 14 - 20 cm tall.

Nursery management Seed starts germinating immediately
after falling on the ground and it is
quite likely that 50 % of the seeds
might have started germination at the
time of collection, therefore, sowing
should be done immediately.
Sowing is done immediately due to the low viability of seeds and
about 60% germination is obtained if seeds are sown immediately after collection.
It reduces to 44%, 1.0% and 5%, respectively after one, two and three weeks of
storage ( Beniwal, 1987b). Seeds are sown in shaded nursery beds vertically to
keep the radical upside. Sowing is done in the mother beds as most of the seeds are
in pre-germinated stage and direct sowing in polythene bags may not give
satisfactory result due to the damage of seeds during transportation or handling.
Germination takes place after one week of sowing and continues to about twentyfive
days. The seedlings become ready for transplanting after 4 to 5 weeks of
sowing. It is a shade bearer in the initial stage, therefore, overhead shade is
necessary in the nursery. Seedlings become ready for plantation in the next rainy

"
39,Haldina cordifolia,"Haldina, Haldu","Seed - it is very small and so should only just be covered with soil. The seed is best sown in a seed-box that is placed in light shade and protected from heavy rain. Water frequently but carefully with a very fine spray. Germination ordinarily takes place in about 20 - 40 days. As soon as the seedlings are large enough to handle, that is, in about two to three months, they should be pricked out about 5cm apart in boxes ; the more vigorous ones may even be pricked out about 10cm apart in nursery-beds. The seedlings will be ready to plant out in the forest early the following rains. Transplanting is not unattended with risk owing to the liability of the seedlings to die of drought ; care is therefore necessary to keep a ball of earth round the roots. Risk is further avoided by pricking out the plants into baskets or bamboo tubes instead of into boxes or nursery-beds, so that there is no interference with the roots during transplanting. Young seedlings grow very slowly in their first year, reaching a height of only 25 - 150mm. And are very susceptible to being washed away or beaten down with rain at this time. Growth is faster in the second year, with plants reaching heights of 30 - 60cm or more. Plants develop a thin but long tap root in their first year, this thickens and develops considerably in the second year. The seed can be stored for at least 12 months."

The seeds are sown in seedbeds, where they are covered with a mixture of sand and soil (1:1) or with a thin layer of sawdust. Germination of fresh seeds is usually good and rapid. About two weeks after germination, when the seedlings are 5 - 6cm tall, they are potted up into individual containers about 15 x 23cm with good drainage holes at their base. It is normally recommended to use a mixture of forest soil and sand (at a ratio of 3:1) as the potting medium in order to introduce the appropriate mycorrhiza to the roots. The seedlings are placed in 50 - 60% sunlight and watered twice daily. Seedlings can be planted out when 30 - 40cm tall - harden the seedlings off in full sunlight for one month prior to planting."

50,Tectona grandis,Teak,"Seed - fresh seed is more difficult to germinate than seed that has been stored for 12 months. If it is necessary to use fruits from the same year they were collected, then they should be subjected to alternate wetting then drying for 24 hours each for 14 days. Stored seed germinates best if soaked for 24 - 48 hours in warm water, prior to sowing, changing the water frequently. Another method of encouraging germination is to char (or half burn) the fruits by covering them with a thin layer of grass and lighting it. The germination rate is low, usually less than 50%, but sometimes up to 80%. Germination usually starts after 10 days but may take 2 - 3 months. Seedlings should be given a little shade for their first year and can then be planted into their permanent positions. Natural regeneration is particularly abundant in forests exposed to fires and often occurs in patches. Seeds collected from the forest floor are generally used to establish plantations. It is recommended that seeds be collected from trees over 20 years old. Seed is often collected from selected stands. Fruit that has lain dormant in the ground for 30 - 40 years has been known to germinate abundantly.  Both grafting and budding methods showed better results than branch cutting methods. The rooting time of cutting is 8 - 15 days, and the survival rate of rooted stock is 90 - 100%."

it is a light demander. It cannot tolerate water logging and prefers sandy loam soil,
therefore, its best growth is found in high table lands or in foot hill regions on well
drained slopes. Flowering occurs in the month of June and the fruits start ripening
by the end of January or at the beginning of March. Ripen fruits are collected from
the ground because it is very difficult to collect them from the standing trees, as
they are extremely tall. Seeds are winged and dispersed by wind. Dipterocarps are
generally irregular seed bearer and period of good crop varies from three to six
years. Seeds are recalcitrant, viability is very low, therefore, cannot be stored for

after about 7 days of sowing and continues up to two months. Krishnaswamy (1952) has
reported 83.2 % germination of the fresh seeds. Seedlings are transplanted into polythene
bags at four-leaved stage or after about one and half months of sowing. According to
Roychowdhary (1960) it is better to sow seeds in bamboo pots (both ends open) and
planting should be done along with the bamboo pots in wet sal areas.
Most of the seedlings and saplings in the natural forests are seen to remain
stunted and in bushy form and may die back due to adverse climatic conditions. The
seedling beaxs a coral like outgrowth in the leaf axis, which results from ""dwarfed bud"".
This stunted growth and dwarfing of bud is noticed in drier areas where soil is very
shallow with shales and sand stone underneath and also with lack of adequate soil cover.

Fruit - pod, 15 to 23 cm X 2 cm wide, and each pod has 8 to 15 bright scarlet seeds.
Seeds are collected by plucking pods, which get twisted on maturity. Seeds are orthodox
due to the hard seed-coat and hence they can be stored for about 24 months. Seed
permeability decreases when stored in open air, however, it does not affect the seed
viability. Scarification (breaking of hard seed-coat) of seeds increases the germination
rate and decreases the germination period drastically. Seeds are also used for decoration
purpose.

collection because of short viability of seeds. After sowing seeds are covered by a thin
layer of soil or straw to maintain the moisture and temperature. Beds are watered twice
daily. Germination starts after 8 to 10 days of sowing and seedlings become ready for
transplanting in polythene bags after about 25 days of germination.
According to Ram Boojh and Ramakrishnan, (1981) alder seeds give best germination
at a constant temperature of 20 °C under continuous light. Germination under
darkness and at depth below 0.5 to 1.0 cm is found to be very poor, and seeds are

moist shady ravines, river banks and in swamps. It is grown as an avenue tree and in tea
and coffee plantations as a nurse tree. It is specially suited for afforestation of those
areas which have high water table. Its leaves decompose immediately and retain good
moisture when used in mulching. The wood is durable under water and specially used
for the construction of bridges, house posts, pile foundation, wheels, boat and rafters.
Fruit - 3 or 4 seeded globose berry, seeds 3 to 4 mm long, trigonous with one round and
two flat sides, light brown and smooth with hard testa. Ripened fruit bunches are
collected by plucking the tip of small branches, when its colour becomes brownish.
Early and late collection of seed should be avoided. Fruits are kept in water for 2 days to
allow the pulp to rot. Then fruits are macerated over wire mesh and washed with tap
water to separate the seeds from pulp. Seeds are smooth and shining. Seeds loose viability
rapidly and should not be stored for longer period. They should be sown immediately
after the collection. It has good coppicing ability and produce vigorous shoots.

Sowing is done in proper shaded mother beds having a mix of sand, FYM and
soil in 1:1:1 ratio. Seeds are sown at a depth of 0.5 to 0.8 cm in lines made at 8 cm
distance and by keeping 4 cm distance between seed to seed. Seeds can be sown by
broadcasting and about 70 g seed will suffice for one square meter bed. Mulching of bed
hastens the germination. Germination is epigeal. It starts after 10 days of sowing and
continues upto one month. .Adequate watering and time to time weeding is essential.
Seedlings are transplanted in polybags after 15-20 days of germination. They become

Cleaned stone are treated with conc. H2So4 for 15 minutes, stirred intermittently
with glass rod. Then washed in tap water three to four times and then soaked in lukewarm
water (40°C) for 48 hours. The water is drained out and seeds are sown in shaded
mother beds at a depth of 1.0 to 1.5 cm. The hard seed coat can also be cracked by
hammer but care should be taken to cause minimum damage to the seed. The stone
pieces having intact seeds are sown in beds which results in early and better germination.
Sowing in shaded mother bed is more fruitful because it takes quite long time to
germinate. Germination is epigeal. Seedlings are transplanted in polythene bags at 2 or
3 leaves stage. After 8 months of germination seedlings become ready to plant in field"
61,Michelia kisopa ,Chobsi,"A tall deciduous tree with smooth grey bark, clean bole and a close tapering
crown. Mature tree attains a hight of 20 to 25 m and 2 to 2.5 m girth. It is found in
eastern Himalayas between 500 to 1500 m elevations. It prefers well-drained soil. Flowers
- pale yellow and appear during April- May. Fruit- aggregate of follicles, 5 to 10 cm
long spikes, ripe carpels sessile, 1 to 1.5 cm in diameter, compressed closely, lenticelled,
2 to 12 seeds in each carpel. It does not produce good seed crop every year. Flowering to
fruiting takes more than one year. Seeds are collected by plucking of ripened fruits when
their colour changes to greyish- brown and seeds become reddish. Fruits are kept in
shade for 2 to 3 days till they open completely. The reddish pulp is removed by macerating
and washing with water. After that, seeds are dried under shade for 1 to 2 days.
Seeds blackish, angular and short lived (recalcitrant) and hence they can not be stored
for even one month. In Assam seeds are normally mixed with red oxide (sindur) which
prevents damages from fungi and insects during storage as well as in nursery beds.

Before sowing seeds are soaked in luke-warm water for 24 hours, after that
water is drained out. Pre-treatment of seeds in 0.5 to 1.0% solution of thio-urea significantly
improved the total germination to 77 and 72%, respectively. Treated seeds start
germination from 9th
 day. Seeds are sown in shaded mother beds at a depth of 0.5 to 1.0
cm covering of beds with dry straw maintained the moisture and enhanced the germination.
Germination starts after 12 to 15 days of sowing and seedlings are transplanted in
polythene bags after one month of germination. The growth of seedlings at initial stage
is slow and it takes about one and half year to become ready for field plantation.

63,Phoebe cooperiana ,Mekahi,"It is a tall tree with a compact crown and a clean bole of 15 to 18 m length. It is
found in tropical forests up to an elevation of 600 m. Bark is greyish, reticulately furrowed,
splitting in flakes. It is known for its quality timber and ripened fruits which are
eaten by local people in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. Now a days it is rarely seen in
forests because of its selective felling for the valuable timber mainly by plywood industries.
Fruit - berry, 2 to 3.5 cm long, ellipsoid mesocarp is aromatic. The ripened fruits
are collected by lopping of branches. Fleshy mesocarp of ripened fruits is removed by
macerating and washing of stone in tap water. Then seeds are dried under light shade
for 2-3 days. The fruits are eaten by the birds and wild animals. Seeds are recalcitrant,
therefore, they can not be stored for long period.

three to four times with tap water and then dried
 1/2 hrs under light shade. Treated seeds
were sown in sand trays and kept in seed germinator at 27 °C . Germination started after
22 days of sowing. It was 59.5% and 68% in 0.5 and 1.0 % KNO3 treatment respectively.
In another treatment, seeds were soaked in tap water for 12 hrs, drained out and
dried for two hours under light shade. These seeds were sown directly in polythene bags
by keeping the pointed end of seed upward. Germination was hypogeal, starting after
about 25 days of sowing and continued for two months or so. The seedlings are ready
for plantation by the next rainy season. It coppices and pollards well. Initial growth is
very fast which slows down gradually"
64,Sapindus emarginatus ,"Ritha,  Manisal","A medium - sized to large deciduous tree with a globose crown and fine leathery
foliage, usually reaching a height of 12-20 m and a girth of 1.8 m. It is native of China,
Japan and cultivated throughout North India (up to 1500m) and in Assam (indigenous).
The fruits are used as shampoo and also have medicinal properties. Fruits - drupe, globose
fleshy, one seeded, 1.8 -2.0 cm across and 0.8 to 1.2 cm in diameter, black and
loose in dry fruit. Ripened fruits are collected from the forest floor / ground under the

65,Spondias pinnata ,Amra,"A moderate sized to large deciduous tree with a pleasant aromatic smell. It attains a
height of 15 to 30 m and a girth of around 1.2 to 3.0 m with spherical crown. It is widely
distributed throughout the country in the tropical wet evergreen and tropical dry deciduous
forests. The species occurs up to 3000 feet elevation. The leafless trees are distinctly visible
during March - May when inflorescences of whitish flowers cover the trees. Fruits - drupe,
3 to 5 cm long, ovoid or oblong, greenish- yellow when ripe, pulp soft. The stone is semiwoody,
fibrous outside and pitted with cavity. Each stone has 2 to 5 seeds but only one is
perfect. Completely ripened fruits are collected by lopping the small branches. Fruits are
heaped for 2 to 5 days to allow the pulp to rot. Then macerated the pulp and washing under
the tap water to clean the stones. The seeds collected from such heap and the fruits discarded
by deer after eating the pulp germinated well. Viability of seeds decrease by 50% after one
year of storage. Fruits are eaten by the wild animals (monkey, pigs, deer etc.) and it has been
noticed that the local people make a machan near the tree to hunt the animals which come to
eat the fruits. In Assam, people plant it in their compound to get fruits as well as leaves for
fodder. Leaves have aromatic smell, sour taste and eaten by the local people.

Seeds are sown directly in polythene bags vertically by keeping micropyle end
upward at a depth of 1.5 to 2.0 cm. Germination is hypogeal. It starts after about 20 days
of sowing and continues for 60 days. One to three seedlings may emerge from the same
stone. Seedlings become ready for plantation after one year of sowing. Stump planting
has also been reported equally successful as seedlings planting in field.
However, sowing in mother beds is advantageous because the process of germination
of seedlings and maintenance of seedlings up to transplanting stage can be easily
and effectively cared. Labour and wastage of polythene bags can be saved in case of
poor germination direct sowing of seeds in field gives better result than planting out
seedlings or stumps.
